                    <p>In a bowl, mix ground beef, egg, onion, bread crumbs, Worcester, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon sald, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper until well blended. Divide mixture into four equal portions and shape each into a patty about 4 inches wide.</p>

Cook burgers, turning once, until browned on both sides and no longer pink inside (cut to test). 7 to 8 minutes total.
